## Airbnb Listings & Reviews  

For this challenge I had the pleasure to analyze Airbnb data for 250,000+ listings in 10 major cities, including information about hosts, pricing, location, and room type, along with over 5 million historical reviews.  
The prices are in local currency.  


### *About the dataset*  
* This dataset contains 2 tables, in csv format
* The Listings table contains over 250,000 Airbnb listings from 10 of the worldâ€™s most visited cities (each record represents one listing), with fields containing details about the host, location, price, type, ratings, etc.
* The Reviews table contains over 5,000,000 Airbnb reviews from the same 10 cities (each record represents one review), with fields containing the listing id, review date, and reviewer id  

I've shared some of the insights I discovered in my [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6789903162741448704/), where you can take a look at the visualization as well ([here](https://github.com/Kal-Sel/Airbnb-analysis-with-Power-BI/blob/main/Airbnb_Dashboard.pdf) as a pdf file, and [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMmU1MDUzOWMtNzRmMy00ZGQwLWE5NzItYjhmMTY5YmMxZGVkIiwidCI6IjdlMWM0MDhjLTkyNDItNDcyYS05NmI4LWQzZjczZWQzYWQyZiJ9&pageName=ReportSection) as the Power BI Dashboard)
